# Titan

Titan is a game engine (for now just a framework) developed by me.
The Engine supports 2D, advanced Mathematics, Windowing, Modern OpenGL and more.
For now it does NOT support 3D Rendering.

## How to use

For now you need to clone the entire repo.

- Clone the repository in an empty folder
- Run `scripts/GenProjects` (Optional)
- Open TitanEngine.sln
- Run SandboxApp.cpp
